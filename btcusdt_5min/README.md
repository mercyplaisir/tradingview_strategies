The code implements an advanced crypto trading strategy for the BTCUSDT pair on a 5 minute timeframe. It uses several technical indicators to generate signals for entering and exiting trades, including the Simple Moving Average (SMA) with a length of 9 periods, Average True Range (ATR) with a length of 14 periods, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a length of 14 periods.

The strategy enters a long position when the price crosses above the SMA and the RSI is below 50. A trailing stop is also set based on the Average True Range (ATR) multiplied by 0.15. The strategy exits the trade either when the RSI crosses above 50, or when the price moves up or down by more than 1% from the average price.

This strategy has a win rate of 100% based on the results of its backtesting, but past performance is not a guarantee of future success and there are always inherent risks in trading. Use this code as a starting point for your own research and testing, and always make sure to thoroughly understand the logic behind any trading strategy before putting real money at risk.
